# Recursive deck generation algorithm based on Rank Biserial Correlation

This program builds two lists of scores out of a list of scores such that the scores in the two lists satisfy a given rank biserial correlation (RBSC) relation [1]. The implementation is done in Python 3.5.2 with no specific dependencies.

Note that this repository addresses a hypothetical case where the scores array is a set of pseudo-random integers. In practice, depending on  the application, one may use number of Google search results [2,3,4] or number of occurrences of a words in a corpus [4] etc. as list of scores. Since a generic hypothetical case is addressed, the program does not yield the two decks themselves but the lists of scores of the cards in the decks. One may simply map the scores back to the cards (i.e. vocabulary) in order to build the decks. 

The algorithm relies on the fact that by adding and removing a single score at a time, the relation between two lists to converge to the desired value of RSSC [6]. For composing the decks, two requirements are posed as uniformity and diversity. These implies that the difficulty level of the cards in the same deck needs to be uniform enough so that they can be grouped together and that the difficulty levels of the cards in different decks need to be diverse enough so that they can be grouped in different decks. The role of RBSC is to assess the levels of uniformity and diversity. An iterative algorithm helps in attaining desired levels of uniformity and diversity based on scores of the cards.
